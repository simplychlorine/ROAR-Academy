When a function includes a list of arguments, it is allowed that the code also declare a default value when no value is provided when the function is called in the code. The first line of printed results indicates this case, when *L, S = func_test()* does not provide the argument values, and the default values of *L = ['a', 'b']* and *S = 'ab'* are used. \n","2. It may come as a surprise that while the same function is called the second time in the same fashion, the returned values of *L* and *S* are different from the first time. This is because an important rule defined in Python regarding the type of an input argument to be mutable or immutable:\n","    * When an argument type is immutable, then its default value will be reset to the one listed in the function definition. In the above example, *S = 'ab'* is immutable string type. Therefore, when its input value is not provided by the function call, the default value is always used.\n","    * When an argument type is mutable, then its default value will be set only once based on the value in the function definition. Subsequently, the default value of a mutable argument remains the same from the last time the function is called. In the above example, when the function is first called, the mutable argument *L* has changed its value to ['a', 'b', 'c']. Therefore, when the function is called the second time without explicit setting the argument value, the default value of *L* is the same value from the last function call. Adding another 'c' to this value will return the result ['a', 'b', 'c', 'c'].\n","   * The third line of printed result illustrates the situation that when a mutable argument is changed inside a function, the modified value is carried over to the outside of the function regardless if the value is part of the function output. However, when an immutable argument is modified inside a function, it is not carried over to change the variable value outside the function. This conclusion makes sense because when the function executes the statement *S = S + 'c'*, the assigned new string *S* is a local string object that has different memory address and ID than the string *S* of the same name outside the function. \n","   \n","   \n","In conclusion, when arguments are passed into a function, mutable variables share the same objects inside and outside the function, while immutable variables do not share the same objects. As a result, changes on immutable variables inside a function do not change the variables of the same names outside. Such immutable variables inside a function are called local variables.\n","\n","Contrast to local variables, Python also defines a keyword called *global* to define global variables. When a variable is declared as global, then Python will force all variables of the same name to share the same object and memory address. Consequently, changing the value of a global variable in one place will affect all the other places in the code when the same variable is used.

When *direction = -1*, the function will return a string that circularly shifts *input_string* elements to the left by one position. When *direction = 1*, the function will return a string that circularly shifts *input_string* elements to the right by one position. Hint: In here, circular shift means whenever an element is shifted outside the range of the existing string, it will be added back to the string from the opposite side such that the total length and all elements remain the same after circular shift."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Timer started\n","Elapsed time: 2.18 seconds\n"]}],"source":["import time\n","\n","# sets starting variables outside of loop so they aren't reset every time it is run\n","state = \"TIC\"\n","start = None\n","\n","def tic_toc():\n","    '''Calling function starts the timer; calling it again stops the timer\n","    \n","    Output: time - Returns time between function calls'''\n","\n","    # declares variables as global\n","    global state\n","    global start\n","\n","    if state == \"TIC\":\n","        start = time.time() # takes down starting time\n","        state = \"TOC\" # changes state to ready computer for stopping input\n","        print(\"Timer started\") # implemented break in function to wait for next input\n","    \n","    elif state == \"TOC\":\n","        state = \"TIC\" # resets condition to prep for next command\n","        elapsed_time = time.time() - start # calculates elapsed time\n","        print('Elapsed time: %.2f seconds' % elapsed_time ) # prints out elapsed time\n","        return elapsed_time\n","\n","tic_toc()\n","\n","if input() == \"stop\":\n","    tic_toc()\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["'mgo'"]},"execution_count":9,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["def circular_shift(input_string, direction):\n","    '''Shifts string to the left or right depending on direction integer input\n","    \n","    Parameters: input_string - String to be altered by the function\n","                direction - 1 or -1 indicating direction of the shift\n","                \n","    Output: change - String after alteration'''\n","\n","    change = list(input_string) # puts string into a list for easier alteration\n","\n","    # shifts directionally depending on parameter\n","    if direction == -1:\n","        change.append(change[0]) # adds first letter to the end\n","        change.pop(0) # removes first letter\n","    elif direction == 1:\n","        change.insert(0, change[-1]) # adds last letter to the beginning\n","        change.pop(-1) # removes last letter\n","    return \"\".join(change) # puts list back into a string\n","\n","circular_shift(\"omg\", -1)"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30042,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":false,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
